    <p>
      Hello, I am Stanley. I typically go by Tagg as a shortened version of my
      middle name of Taggart. I live in Pleasant Grove, UT. My wife and I have
      been married for just under 18 years and we have 3 kids ages 15, 12, and
      8.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been a member of the church of Jeasus Christ of Latter-Day Saints
      for 31 years. I enojy all the teachings of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently a Network Engineer and have been doing that for the last 15
      years along with System and Linux Admin type roles sprinkled in there
      depending on the company I was with. I enjoy technology and have been
      tinkering with all sorts of programming and sysadmin type things since I
      was in 8th grade.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am working towards a Software Development BS. The reason for going after
      that degree is I have always like programming as a hobby and have been
      mostly self taught, but I want to get better and possibly move into it as
      a career. I can always use the skills I learn along the way in my current
      career as a lot of things I do can be automated and done as infrastruture
      as code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of my none technology related hobbies are mountain biking, working on my
      cars, gardening, and woodworking. I look forward to learning with everyone
      in this class!
